The behavioral interview is an interviewing technique that employers use to evaluate a potential employee.
To accelerate the recruiting process and make recruiting on
a simple scale while improving the applicant experience. This
proposed model automatically analyses and predicts the non-verbal characteristics of an interviewee and also provides relevant
feedback. This video-based analysis includes facial expressions
and body gestures. To implement such a model, various regression, classification, and deep learning algorithms are used. Many
use regression as an evaluation metric but we are planning to use
classification algorithms to build this model. By using analytic
methods, in this model, we’ll try to predict the consequences
and prescribe feedback based on the behavior of the candidates.
Through this project, we will be testing the following hypothesis
“The first impression is the best impression” and output the traits
that the candidate lacked during the interview and also provide
necessary suggestions on how to improve them.
